## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a React Crash Course project where we created a Meetup List application. It is my first React project, and it was built by following the tutorial from Academind on YouTube.

- **YouTube Tutorial:** [React Crash Course - Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk)
- **Original CSS Source:** [Academind GitHub Repository](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/zz-reactjs-summary/extra-files)

The project features a Meetup List with the following main pages:

- **Home Page:** Displaying a list of meetups.
- **Favorites Page:** Displaying a list of favorite meetups.
- **Add New Meetup Page:** Allowing users to add new meetups.

The application uses Firebase to store and manage meetup data.
