# Learning React Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my "Learning React Repository." This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn and improve my skills in React. Here, you'll find various React projects, each contained in its own branch, showcasing my progress and development journey.

## Projects

### Current Project
Here is the current project I am working on:

[React-Crash-Course](https://github.com/khowellmobile/Learning-React.js/tree/React-Course)
  - As this is my second project I wanted to keep it simple and straight forward by doing a quote website similar to one of my other projects but using react instead.

### Past Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on as part of my journey:

1. [React-Crash-Course](https://github.com/khowellmobile/Learning-React.js/tree/React-Course)
   - This was my first project where I followed a crash course on youtube
